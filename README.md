Symfony Invaders
================

Space Invaders in a Symfony Console Application

### Installation

Clone project, run `composer install`.

Launch application with `app/console invaders:launch --no-debug`.

Select the default `parameters.yml` options during composer install, or update them for a greater challenge!

Make sure your terminal is larger than 120x40 on startup for best results.

### Game over

Type `reset` in your terminal to reset the keyboard input. I'll try to fix this at some point.
